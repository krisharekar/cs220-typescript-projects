## ðŸ“š Assignment Overview

| Assignment | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Image Processing** | Implement basic image transformations using functional programming techniques. |
| **Image Processing with HOF** | Enhance image processing by applying higher-order functions. |
| **Lists** | Work with list structures and recursive functions. |
| **Closures and Iterators** | Explore closures and custom iterator implementations. |
| **Oracles** | Develop property-based tests for the Stable Matching Problem. |
| **Streams and Series** | Evaluate formal power series using streams. |
| **Fluent Filter and JSON** | Manipulate JSON data with fluent interfaces. |
| **Fetching and Web APIs** | Interact with web APIs and handle asynchronous data fetching. |
| **Building an Interpreter** | Construct an interpreter for a subset of JavaScript, handling parsing and execution. |

> ðŸ“Œ Each assignment resides in its own directory.
